### Baselines

Under the proposed benchmarks, we evaluate existing FSOD methods, including meta-learning-based methods and fine-tuning learning.

#### meta-learning methods
* A-RPN [6], the official implementation is [here](https://github.com/fanq15/FewX)
* H-GCN [7], the official implementation is [here](https://github.com/GuangxingHan/QA-FewDet)  
* Meta-RCNN [8],  the official implementation is [here](https://github.com/guangxinghan/meta-faster-r-cnn)

#### fine-tuned learning
* TFA [9], the official implementation is [here](https://github.com/ucbdrive/few-shot-object-detection)
* FSCE [10], the official implementation is [here](https://github.com/megvii-research/FSCE)
* DeFRCN [11], the official implementation is [here](https://github.com/er-muyue/DeFRCN)

## Quick Start

#### 1. Requirements.
* python >= 3.8
* detectron2 == 0.6
* PyTorch >= 1.9 & torchvision that matches the PyTorch version.
* CUDA==11.3
* GCC >= 5.4
#### 2. Download the pre-trained weights (R101-FPN, 3x) from [detectron/model_zoo](https://github.com/facebookresearch/detectron2/blob/main/MODEL_ZOO.md)ï¼Œput it in the folder pretrained/.

#### 3. Download the pre-processed datasets from [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1RLfAMTS6Z-ArpqYIO6FoH1xv9JZ1X4HU/view?usp=sharing), put it in the folder datasets.

#### 4. Fine-tuning and Evaluation

```
    bash run.sh [dataset]
```
    
For example:

```
    bash run.sh DIOR
```
